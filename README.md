This project was implemented during the summer training period for the year 2020 at (Smart Methods) Company and the property rights are reserved for them.

# Project idea:
a Complete robot control panel connected to  a database by html and php files.


# Project description:
- This project is to design a Complete robot control panel linked to a database that stores the movements that the robot has taken, this project consists of (html & php) files and the database used is (MySQL).

The HTML page contains 5 buttons that control the movements of the robot by pointing to one of the directions, which are (Right - Left - Forward - Backward - STOP), and a background with a robot image, the way this project works is that when a certain direction button is pressed, a new page opens that tells the robot about the direction of movement and is recorded at the same moment in the database as well.

The PHP page contains the used method (GET), and the entry command must be in the database.

A saperate page of the type of PHP contains identification and connection to the database and its information.
